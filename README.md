# test-cli

A sample CLI tool demonstrating modern Go CLI development practices with automated build and distribution.

## Overview

test-cli serves as an example CLI application showcasing:
- Production-grade build automation with GoReleaser
- Multi-platform distribution (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Professional development tooling with mise
- Comprehensive testing setup
- Automated Homebrew tap integration

## Installation

### Via Homebrew
```bash
brew tap s-matsubara/homebrew-tap
brew install test-cli
```

### Via mise

There are two ways to install via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

#### 1. Using the ubi plugin

This method downloads prebuilt binaries from GitHub Releases.

Add the following to your `.mise.toml` file:

```toml
"ubi:s-matsubara/test-cli" = "latest"
```

Then run:

```bash
mise install test-cli
```

#### 2. Using plugin.toml (Custom plugin)

This repository includes a `plugin.toml` file to support installation as a custom plugin.

This file defines how to install versioned binaries from GitHub Releases using `mise`. It maps OS/architecture identifiers and sets up proper asset naming for automated installation.

To use this method, run:

```bash
mise plugin add test-cli https://github.com/s-matsubara/test-cli.git
mise install test-cli@latest
```

### From Releases

go build -o test-cli
```
